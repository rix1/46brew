 * Tetsu Kasuya's original formula is:

 *
 * That gives us the following coffee to water ratio
 *    1 / (3 x pours) => 0.0666...
 *
 * Which is slightly more than 0.065 (my personal base) and what I use
 * to convert water to coffee in `getCoffeeWeight()` 👇
 *
 * To improve accuracy over Kasuya's formula I calculate a custom COFFEE_MULTIPLIER:
